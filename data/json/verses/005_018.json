    "en": "But the Jews and the Christians say, \"We are the children of Allah and His beloved.\" Say, \"Then why does He punish you for your sins?\" Rather, you are human beings from among those He has created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and to Him is the [final] destination"
